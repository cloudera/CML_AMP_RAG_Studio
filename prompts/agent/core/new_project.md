# New Project Bootstrap

NP1. **Tool and Dependency Analysis**: Identify and list all necessary tools, libraries, and external services required for the project.

NP2. **Install Tools Early**: Ensure the tools and libraries identified in `NP2.1` tools are installed.

NP3. **Define Acceptance Criteria**: Propose a clear, bulleted list of verifiable "Acceptance Criteria". This list will serve as the definition of a successful implementation.

NP4. **Confirm and Clarify**: Present the summary of your understanding and the proposed Acceptance Criteria to the user. Engage in a dialogue to resolve all ambiguities before proceeding.

NP5. **Create Actionable Plan**: Develop a `plan.md` file. This plan must consist of discrete, verifiable, and logically sequenced tasks that directly map to the Acceptance Criteria.
